The aime was to create the stamp auction web site for the imagenery owner Lord Stampee. 

According to Lord Stampee's quote, the stamp auction website should look like this:

    A simple and easy-to-navigate platform targeting customers over the age of 45.
    Useful and appropriate functionality, such as member profiles, a quick search bar, easily viewable photos, and more.
    A classic, streamlined aesthetic without compromising functionality. 
    The platform should be simple and consistent. Red or blue should be present in the interface.
